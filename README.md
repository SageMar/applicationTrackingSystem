  - Things you need to follow up on
  - Jobs you tagged but haven't applied to yet

## How to get this project up and running on Mac if using VSCode
1. Clone this repository with `https://github.com/tien-han/applicationTrackingSystem.git` to get access to the code.
2. Download and install PHP
2a. If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed already, you can run `brew install php` (https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/php).
3. In the VSCode extensions tab, download and install "Live Server" and "PHP Server".
3a. Live Server launches your project into the browser and enables "live updating" each time you make a change, but only for front end files (JS, HTML, CSS).
3b. PHP Server launches the front end code and PHP backend so that your PHP can actually be run.

#### Note: For #4 & #5, these two extensions will use different ports when launched, so they don't really work "together". If you want them to work together, you also have to follow step #6.
4. If you are only working on front end code:
On any HTML page, click "Go Live" on the lower right corner to launch your front end (HTML/CSS/JS/etc). The browser will auto reload/refresh when you make code changes.
5. If you are working on front end or backend code:
On any HTML or PHP page, right click in the window and click "PHP Server: Serve Project" to launch your backend. You will have to refresh your browser since it doesn't update.

6. [Download Live Server Web Extension if Using Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/live-server-web-extension/)
